        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Ringo is a quiz for memorizing kanji through simple Japanese words. It keeps track of
            your accuracy for each kanji and prioritizes the ones you have struggled with the most.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently a work in progress, but the core functionality is implemented along with
            words for the 80 kanji taught in the first grade. The project page can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/wsitu/ringo">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>How To</h2>
        <p>
            Before the quiz starts, the underlined words and their definition are shown.
            An optional slider at the top controls the difficulty of the quiz and at below the
            words, the accuracy of each kanji used is displayed as bars. To start the quiz
            press the large button labeled "Next".
        </p>
        <p>
            The quiz lists each word on the left with its kanji replaced by a circle. Pick the
            correct kanji using the buttons on the right side and if you answered correctly, they
            will all turn green. Once all words are filled out, press the "Next" button again to
            start a new quiz.
