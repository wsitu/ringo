            Ringo is a quiz for memorizing kanji through simple Japanese words. It keeps track of
            your accuracy for each kanji and prioritizes the ones you have struggled with the most.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently a work in progress, but the core functionality is implemented along with
            words for the 80 kanji taught in the first grade. The project page can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/wsitu/ringo">here</a>.
